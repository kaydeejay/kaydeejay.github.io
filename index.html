                Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Kevin, and I'm learning to be a software developer. Currently I'm enrolled in the Penn LPS Boot Camp at UPenn in Philadelphia. Before that, I spent a lot of time learning from online resources like freecodecamp.org and Eloquent Javascript, and am always excited to learn new technologies.

                I graduated from the University of Miami with a BA in Theatre Arts in 2011, and moved to New York. From there I worked in Regional Theatres up and down the East Coast, and I performed in <i>Spider-Man: Turn Off The Dark</i> on Broadway.

                I now live in Bucks County, PA, with my wife Kristin. I've been spending the last couple of years learning the fundamentals of programming and development, and I'm hoping to make a career change. I've always loved working with computers, both software and hardware.
